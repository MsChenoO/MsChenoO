## Chen Yuan

**Hands-on Software Engineer** | **GenAI/ML Builder** | **Startup Contributor**

Building production-ready AI systems and data infrastructure. Execution-first engineer who ships code, not just architectures.

### What I'm Building

**AI Systems & LLM Infrastructure**
- [**Sentinel**](https://github.com/yourusername/Sentinel) - Production supervision framework for AI systems. Dual-LLM architecture for safety verification (PII detection, prompt injection defense, code injection prevention). Treating LLMs like distributed system components with deterministic verification flows.
- [**BrandPulseAI**](https://github.com/yourusername/BrandPulseAI) - Enterprise brand monitoring platform powered by LangChain + Ollama. Event-driven microservices with Redis Streams, real-time sentiment analysis, and semantic search using pgvector. Currently shipping Phase 2.

**Full-Stack & Data Engineering**
- Built real-time data pipelines with Kafka + Spark Streaming for stock market analysis
- Deployed LLM-based text summarization APIs (BART, T5) with FastAPI
- Created production matchmaking algorithms at scale (Mingle - 30k+ users)

### Tech Stack

**AI/ML:** LangChain, Ollama (llama3, mistral), Hugging Face Transformers, pgvector
**Backend:** Python, Node.js, FastAPI, Django, Flask
**Data:** Kafka, Spark Streaming, Airflow, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Elasticsearch
**Cloud/DevOps:** AWS (S3, Redshift), Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD
**Frontend:** React, Redux, Next.js

### Current Focus

Shipping production-grade GenAI applications with emphasis on:
- AI safety and supervision patterns
- Multi-model orchestration
- Real-time event processing
- Vector search and semantic understanding

### Background

MS in Data Science @ Illinois Tech (3.7 GPA) | Software Engineer @ StartNation (stealth startup) | Previously @ Mingle

Building at the intersection of software engineering and AI. Open to collaborating on LLM infrastructure, AI agents, and production ML systems.
